# Wrap complex in a C library
# Many of the same function as Tutorial, but for C.

# Several tests have a 'char *outbuf+intent(out)' argument
# which will force a C bufferify wrapper to be created.
# The size of this buffer is controlled by lenoutbuf.
# This feature is helpful for the C tests since a C wrapper is not required
# for each function since we do not need to deal with name mangling
# like in C++.
